To Do List:

Week 1 (1/9 to 1/15):
	Wednesday - Sunday:
		--Get the flow chart done
		--Make a barebones Units.java and Terain.java  
		  that can be instantiated.
		--Fill terrainLayer and unitLayer in Woo.java with Terrain and Units objects
		--Woo.java should be able to print out the terrainlayer and unitlayer
		-- Program the movement method of Units.
		-- Program start(), runTurn(), and playerParser() to work with one player and one unit


Week 2 (1/16 to 1/23): 
	Monday - Wednesday:

		-- Test if we can play a basic game with instances of Units.
		-- Program Land.java and Sea.java so they can be instantiated
		-- Program Infantry.java 
		-- Program Navy.java
	Thursday - Friday:
		--Debugging. At this point, it's too risky to add new features
